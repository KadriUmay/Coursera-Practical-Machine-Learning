## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

The approach proposed for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer. The "how (well)" investigation  provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.

The quality of execution is defined for Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions. Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
	* A - Exactly according to the specification 
	* B - Throwing the elbows to the front
	* C - Lifting the dumbbell only halfway
	* D - Lowering the dumbbell only halfway
	* E - Throwing the hips to the front

We will try to classify the quality of exeuction in one of the 5 different classes based on the data collected from the on-body sensors while the exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience and simulating the mistakes.
